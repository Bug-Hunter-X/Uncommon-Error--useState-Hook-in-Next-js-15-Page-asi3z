# Uncommon Error: useState Hook in Next.js 15 Page

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in Next.js 15 when using the `useState` hook within a page component that isn't properly structured as a functional component.  This is often missed when migrating from older versions of Next.js or React. 

## Problem

Attempting to directly use `useState` inside a page component that's not set up to handle it will result in an error. This is because Next.js 15's rendering behavior and React's component lifecycle differ and need to be correctly aligned.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring your page component is a functional component that utilizes the `useState` hook appropriately, or leveraging alternative state management techniques like React's Context API if necessary.
